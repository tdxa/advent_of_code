# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code Solutions ðŸŽ„

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code challenges implemented in TypeScript. Each folder for a specific year contains its own `README.md` file summarizing the status of solved tasks for that year.

## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an annual online event created by Eric Wastl. Starting on December 1st, it presents an advent calendar of small programming puzzles that participants solve using their programming skills and creativity. Each day unveils a new challenge, fostering problem-solving and coding abilities.
